# super_simple_chess_game
Basic chess game I made in my free time from a local repository, unfortunately since I didn't spend too much time on it
it's unable to perform en passant and detect a multitude of ivalid moves or spot checks it can however castle and promote
when a pawn reaches the back rank. There are some simple invalid moves like taking your own piece but otherwise it's more
like over the board chess where it relies on each player's ability and understanding of how to play properly. There are 
also two features, you can either rotate the board manually or let the board rotate after each move as well as reset the board
when/if needed.
