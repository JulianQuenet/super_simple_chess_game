# super_simple_chess_game
Basic chess game I made in my free time, it is unable to perform en passant, but it can castle and pieces can be promoted 
when they reach the back rank. There are some simple invalid moves like taking your own piece but otherwise it's more
like over the board chess where it relies on each player's ability and understanding of how to play properly. There are 
also two features, you can either rotate the board manually or let the board rotate after each move as well as reset the board
when/if needed.
